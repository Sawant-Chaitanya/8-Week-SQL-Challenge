## SQL Query Explanation


### Step 1: Common Table Expression (CTE) to Fetch 'pro annual' Subscribers
```sql
-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to fetch customers who subscribed to the 'pro annual' plan
WITH ProAnnualSubscribers AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        start_date AS start_annual
    FROM 
        subscriptions s
    INNER JOIN 
        plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE 
        plan_name = 'pro annual'
)
```
In this step, we define a CTE named `ProAnnualSubscribers` to fetch customers who subscribed to the 'pro annual' plan. We select the customer_id and start_date (renamed as start_annual) from the `subscriptions` table where the plan_name is 'pro annual'.

### Step 2: Common Table Expression (CTE) to Fetch 'trial' Subscribers
```sql
-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to fetch customers who subscribed to the 'trial' plan
TrialSubscribers AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        start_date AS start_trial
    FROM 
        subscriptions s
    INNER JOIN 
        plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE 
        plan_name = 'trial'
)
```
Similarly, we define another CTE named `TrialSubscribers` to fetch customers who subscribed to the 'trial' plan. We select the customer_id and start_date (renamed as start_trial) from the `subscriptions` table where the plan_name is 'trial'.

### Step 3: Main Query to Calculate Average Days to Join the 'pro annual' Plan for Each 30-Day Period
```sql
-- Main query to calculate the average days to join the 'pro annual' plan for each 30-day period
SELECT 
    CONCAT(
        (DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30) * 30 + 1, '-', 
        (DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30 + 1) * 30
    ) AS period_range,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual)) AS average_days_to_join_annual
FROM 
    ProAnnualSubscribers AS pas
INNER JOIN 
    TrialSubscribers AS ts ON pas.customer_id = ts.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    (DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30);
```
In this step, we calculate the average days to join the 'pro annual' plan for each 30-day period using the `TrialSubscribers` and `ProAnnualSubscribers` CTEs.
- The CONCAT function generates the period range based on the difference in days between the start_trial and start_annual dates. For example, if the difference is 60 days, the period range will be '31-60'.
- The AVG function calculates the average difference in days for each period.
- The GROUP BY clause groups the data by the period range, ensuring that we get the average for each 30-day interval.

### Logic Explanation:

 logic behind the calculation of the `period_range` using the CONCAT function:

```SQL
CONCAT(
    (DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30) * 30 + 1, '-', 
    (DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30 + 1) * 30
) AS period_range
```

1. **Calculate the Number of 30-Day Periods:**
   - `DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30`: This calculates the difference in days between the start_trial (trial start date) and start_annual (pro annual start date), and then divides it by 30 to get the number of 30-day periods between the two dates. This gives us the number of full 30-day periods that have elapsed.

2. **Calculate the Start Day of the Period:**
   - `(DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30) * 30 + 1`: This multiplies the number of 30-day periods by 30 to get the total number of days covered by those periods. Then adds 1 to get the start day of the first 30-day period. This gives us the start day of the period range.

3. **Calculate the End Day of the Period:**
   - `(DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual) / 30 + 1) * 30`: This calculates the start day of the next 30-day period by adding 1 to the number of 30-day periods, then multiplying by 30. This gives us the end day of the period range.

4. **Concatenate the Start and End Days:**
   - `CONCAT(...)`: This function concatenates the start and end days of the period range with a hyphen (-) in between. This forms the period range string.

### Example:

Let's consider a sample row where `DATEDIFF(day, ts.start_trial, pas.start_annual)` returns 90 days (3 months), which means the trial started 90 days before the annual subscription started.

- **Start Day of the Period:**
  - `(90 / 30) * 30 + 1` = `(3) * 30 + 1` = `91`

- **End Day of the Period (Start Day of Next Period):**
  - `(90 / 30 + 1) * 30` = `(3 + 1) * 30` = `120`

- **Concatenated Period Range:**
  - `91 - 120`

This logic dynamically calculates the period range based on the difference in days between the trial start date and the pro annual start date, ensuring accurate categorization of customers into 30-day periods.
