## Solution
```SQL
-- CTE to get plan details including the next date for each customer up to '2020-12-31'
WITH PlanDetails AS (
    SELECT *,
           -- Using LEAD function to get the next date for each customer
           LEAD(start_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS next_date
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31' -- Filtering data up to '2020-12-31'
)

-- Main query to calculate the customer count and percentage breakdown for each plan_name
SELECT 
    P.plan_id,
    P.plan_name,
    COUNT(C.plan_id) AS customer_count,
    -- Calculating the percentage of each plan type among all customers
    (CAST(COUNT(C.plan_id) AS FLOAT) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)) AS percentage_customer
FROM 
    PlanDetails C
LEFT JOIN 
    plans P ON C.plan_id = P.plan_id
-- Filtering data for customers whose next date is after '2020-12-31' or whose next date is NULL (indicating they are still subscribed)
WHERE 
    next_date IS NULL OR next_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY 
    P.plan_id, P.plan_name
ORDER BY 
    P.plan_id;
```

## SQL Query Explanation

### Step 1: Common Table Expression (CTE) to Get Plan Details Up to '2020-12-31'

```sql
WITH PlanDetails AS (
    SELECT *,
           LEAD(start_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS next_date
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
)
```

In this step, we define a CTE named `PlanDetails` to fetch plan details for each customer up to '2020-12-31'. We use the LEAD function to get the next start_date for each customer. The data is filtered to include only records up to '2020-12-31'.

### Step 2: Main Query to Calculate Customer Count and Percentage Breakdown

```sql
SELECT 
    P.plan_id,
    P.plan_name,
    COUNT(C.plan_id) AS customer_count,
    (CAST(COUNT(C.plan_id) AS FLOAT) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)) AS percentage_customer
FROM 
    PlanDetails C
LEFT JOIN 
    plans P ON C.plan_id = P.plan_id
WHERE 
    next_date IS NULL OR next_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY 
    P.plan_id, P.plan_name
ORDER BY 
    P.plan_id;
```

In this step, we perform the main query:
- We select the plan_id and plan_name from the `plans` table, along with the customer count for each plan.
- We calculate the percentage of each plan type among all customers using the COUNT function and a subquery to get the total count of distinct customer_ids.
- The LEFT JOIN with the `plans` table is used to get the plan_name associated with each plan_id.
- We filter the data to include only customers whose next date is after '2020-12-31' or whose next date is NULL, indicating they are still subscribed after the specified date.
- Finally, the results are grouped by plan_id and plan_name and ordered by plan_id.
