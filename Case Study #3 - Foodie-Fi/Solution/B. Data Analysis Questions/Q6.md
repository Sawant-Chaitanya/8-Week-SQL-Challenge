## 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
```SQL
-- CTE to get plan details including the next plan for each customer
WITH PlanDetails AS (
    SELECT *,
        -- Using LEAD function to get the next plan for each customer
        LEAD(plan_id, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY plan_id) AS next_plan
    FROM subscriptions
)
-- Main query to calculate the number and percentage of each customer plan after their initial free trial
SELECT 
    p.plan_name AS plan_name,
    COUNT(pd.next_plan) AS customer_count,
    CAST(COUNT(pd.next_plan) AS FLOAT) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions) AS percentage
FROM 
    PlanDetails pd
LEFT JOIN 
    plans p ON pd.next_plan = p.plan_id
WHERE  
    pd.plan_id = 0 AND pd.next_plan IS NOT NULL -- Filtering data for customers who churned straight after their initial free trial (plan_id = 0) and have a next plan
GROUP BY 
    p.plan_name
ORDER BY 
    customer_count;
```
