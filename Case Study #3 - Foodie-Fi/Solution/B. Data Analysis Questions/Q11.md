## SQL Query Explanation

### Common Table Expression (CTE) to Fetch Subscription Details
```sql
-- CTE to fetch subscription details with the next plan for each customer
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT *, 
        LEAD(plan_id, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY plan_id) AS nxt_plan
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
)
```
In this step, we create a CTE named `CTE` to fetch subscription details for each customer along with the next plan they subscribed to. The `LEAD` function is used to fetch the next plan_id for each customer, ordered by plan_id. We also include a WHERE clause to filter the records to include only those with a start_date before or on December 31, 2020.

### Main Query to Count Downgrades
```sql
-- Main query to count the number of downgrades from pro monthly to basic monthly plan
SELECT COUNT(*) AS downgrade_cnt
FROM CTE 
WHERE nxt_plan = 1  -- Next plan is basic monthly
  AND plan_id = 2;   -- Current plan is pro monthly

```
This main query counts the number of downgrades from the pro monthly to the basic monthly plan. It filters the records from the CTE where the `nxt_plan` is the basic monthly plan (plan_id = 1) and the current plan is the pro monthly plan (plan_id = 2). The COUNT(*) function is used to count the number of records meeting the criteria, giving us the count of downgrades.
