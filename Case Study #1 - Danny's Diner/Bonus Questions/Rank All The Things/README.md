Here's the breakdown of the provided query:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: 
   - The CTE named `SalesMenuMembers` joins the necessary tables (`sales`, `menu`, and `members`) and calculates the member status for each customer based on their join date.
   - It selects columns such as `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, `product_price`, and `member_status`.
   - It uses a `CASE` statement to determine if the customer is a member (`'Y'`) or not (`'N'`) based on their order date and join date.

```sql
-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to join the necessary tables and calculate member status
WITH SalesMenuMembers AS (
  SELECT
    sl.customer_id,
    sl.order_date,
    mn.product_name,
    mn.price AS product_price,
    -- Check if the customer is a member or not based on their join date
    CASE 
      WHEN sl.order_date >= mm.join_date THEN 'Y'   -- If the order date is after or equal to the join date, mark as 'Y'
      ELSE 'N' -- If not, mark as 'N'
    END AS member_status
  FROM 
    sales AS sl
  INNER JOIN 
    menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id 
  LEFT JOIN 
    members AS mm ON sl.customer_id = mm.customer_id
)
```

2. **Main Query**: 
   - The main query selects all columns from the CTE.
   - It calculates the ranking of products based on the order date if the customer is a member using the `DENSE_RANK()` function.
   - If the customer is not a member, the ranking is set to `null`.

```sql
-- Main query to calculate the ranking of products based on order date if the customer is a member
SELECT 
  *,
  CASE  
    WHEN member_status = 'N' THEN null  -- If not a member, set the ranking as null
    ELSE DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, member_status ORDER BY order_date) -- Rank the products by order date if the customer is a member
  END AS ranking
FROM 
  SalesMenuMembers;
```

This query provides the ranking of products based on the order date for each customer, considering their membership status.
