```SQL
SELECT
  sl.customer_id,
  sl.order_date,
  mn.product_name,
  mn.price AS product_price,
  -- Check if the customer is a member or not based on their join date
  CASE 
    WHEN sl.order_date >= mm.join_date THEN 'Y' -- If the order date is after or equal to the join date, mark as 'Y'
    ELSE 'N' -- If not, mark as 'N'
  END AS member 
FROM 
  sales AS sl
INNER JOIN 
  menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id 
LEFT JOIN 
  members AS mm ON sl.customer_id = mm.customer_id; 

```

Here's the breakdown of the provided query:

1. **Selecting Columns**: 
   - Selecting the columns `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, and `price`.
   - Renaming `mn.price` as `product_price`.
   - Adding a case statement to determine if the customer is a member or not based on their join date.

```sql
SELECT
  sl.customer_id,
  sl.order_date,
  mn.product_name,
  mn.price AS product_price,
  -- Check if the customer is a member or not based on their join date
  CASE 
    WHEN sl.order_date >= mm.join_date THEN 'Y' -- If the order date is after or equal to the join date, mark as 'Y'
    ELSE 'N' -- If not, mark as 'N'
  END AS member 
```

2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - Joining the `sales` table (`sl`) with the `menu` table (`mn`) using `product_id`.
   - Performing a left join with the `members` table (`mm`) based on `customer_id`.

```sql
FROM 
  sales AS sl
INNER JOIN 
  menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id 
LEFT JOIN 
  members AS mm ON sl.customer_id = mm.customer_id;
```

The resulting dataset will include columns for `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, `product_price`, and `member`, where `member` indicates whether the customer is a member (`'Y'`) or not (`'N'`).
