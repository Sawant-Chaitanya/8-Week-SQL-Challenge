### Step-by-Step Explanation of Query

#### 1. Common Table Expression (CTE) to Calculate Points Earned

```sql
-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to join the necessary tables and calculate points earned by each customer
WITH SalesMenuMembers AS (
  SELECT
    sl.customer_id,
    sl.order_date,
    mn.product_name,
    mn.price,
    -- Check if the customer is a member or not based on their join date
    CASE 
      WHEN sl.order_date BETWEEN mm.join_date AND DATEADD(DAY, 6, mm.join_date) THEN mn.price * 20  -- If the order date is within the first week after join date, apply the 2x multiplier
      WHEN mn.product_name = 'sushi' THEN mn.price * 20  -- If the product is sushi, apply the 2x multiplier
      ELSE mn.price * 10  -- Otherwise, apply the regular multiplier
    END AS points
  FROM 
    sales AS sl
  INNER JOIN 
    menu AS mn ON sl.product_id = mn.product_id 
  -- Join with the members table to get the join date
  INNER JOIN 
    members AS mm ON sl.customer_id = mm.customer_id
)
```

- **Purpose**: This CTE calculates the points earned by each customer for their purchases.
- **Code Explanation**:
  - It selects the customer_id, order_date, product_name, and price from the sales and menu tables.
  - It calculates the points earned for each product based on the order date, product name, and membership status.
  - The points are calculated as 20 times the price if the order is placed within the first week after the customer joins the program or if the product is sushi. Otherwise, it's 10 times the price.
  - The result is stored in a temporary table named "SalesMenuMembers".

#### 2. Main Query to Calculate Total Points Earned in January

```sql
-- Main query to calculate the total points earned by each customer at the end of January
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM 
  SalesMenuMembers
WHERE 
  YEAR(order_date) = 2021 AND MONTH(order_date) = 1  -- Filter for orders in January
GROUP BY 
  customer_id;
```

- **Purpose**: This main query calculates the total points earned by each customer for orders placed in January.
- **Code Explanation**:
  - It selects the customer_id and sums up the points earned for each customer.
  - The WHERE clause filters the orders to include only those placed in January of 2021.
  - The results are grouped by customer_id to calculate the total points earned by each customer.

This explanation outlines how the query works step by step, ensuring clarity and understanding of each part of the code.


#### Result Table

| Customer ID | Total Points Earned |
|-------------|---------------------|
| A           | 1370                |
| B           | 820                 |
